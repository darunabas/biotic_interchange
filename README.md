To explore biotic interchange by testing for dispersal events among different biomes and the directionality of the transitions
To explore the timing of the biotic interchange
To explore which biomes serve as primary sources and sinks of biodiversity (i.e., providers and receivers of lineages)
To explore the predictors of biotic interchange at a global scale
